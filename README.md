# Notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks with solutions to the CIML textbook and variety of other ML algorithm implementations.

## Usage

Currently, the GitHub notebook preview has some trouble rendering the LaTeX, interactive elements and the shield buttons. I would recommend using Google's **Colaboratory** or Jupyter's **nbviewer** to view these notebooks.
